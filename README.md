# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

In this analysis I am buidling a neural network model to help predict if applicants are successful if funded by Aplhabet soup. 

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
The target is the values in the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column. 

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The features are the different application types.
 
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
The status and the asked amount from the applicants can be removed from the dataset. 

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
I was not able to higher the accuracy to 75%.

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
I increased the number of epochs, added an additional hidden layer and increased the number of nodes in each hidden layer. 

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. 
Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
